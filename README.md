# Hi, I’m Sek 👋

I’m a developer driven by one principle:  
**code and system are the same thing — and the system is a long journey I will keep exploring.**

---

## 🚀 What I Build

- Portfolio-grade applications (Next.js + Firebase + Zod + TypeScript)
- Systems with **security, validation, and monitoring baked in**
- Clean, documented, and scalable codebases that feel like a team built them

## 💡 Philosophy

> _“I sometimes use AI as a coding partner, but I don’t consider code mine unless I fully understand it.
> For me, ownership means being able to explain every line, why it’s there, and how it fits into the system.
> That’s what ensures the end product is truly mine. I know I haven’t reached my full potential yet because
> there are still lines I can’t fully explain — and that gap is my purpose to keep closing. AI doesn’t weaken that
> pursuit; if it helps me reach understanding one line faster, it’s not a bad influence, it’s a sharper tool.
> The responsibility to truly own the code will always stay with me. To me, code and system are the same thing;
> when I treat them as one, I accept that the system is a long journey I will keep exploring.”_
